### **About Me**

I am passionate about software development, responsible artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, and, most importantly, working on projects that aid people in need. I am also a part of clubs on campus, such as the Computer Science Club and Girls Who Code, where I can meet people with similar goals and build my knowledge base in the tech world. In my free time, I enjoy learning more about the world by exploring nature and volunteering for organizations that aim to make a positive impact. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing my professional portfolio through working on machine learning and general software projects
- 📈 I’m currently learning more about the software development life cycle through expanding my computer science education
