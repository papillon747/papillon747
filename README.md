## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### **About Me**

My name is Shivali Upadhyay, and I am currently a student at San Jose State University, majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about software development, responsible artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, and, most importantly, working on projects that aid people in need. I am also a part of clubs on campus, such as the Computer Science Club and Girls Who Code, where I can meet people with similar goals and build my knowledge base in the tech world. In my free time, I enjoy learning more about the world by exploring nature and volunteering for organizations that aim to make a positive impact. 

Feel free to look through my projects linked below, which will explain more about my âœ¨passionsâœ¨ and skill set!
